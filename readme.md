<h1>Drift + Apptopia App Bot</h1>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> we get people asking us for data on an app every day. It's a great source for lead gen. </p>
<p>Previously, we'd collect the email and pass the lead to sales for follow-up. It was a crappy experience.</p>
<p>With this bot, users can enter an app name on our site and see a 'taste' of our data.</p>
<h3>Gotchas</h3>
<p>This was a weekend project. As such, the code could use some cleaning and there are unecessary modules.</p>
